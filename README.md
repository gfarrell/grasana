# Asana Dependency Graph Generator

This project generates a dependency graph for an Asana project so you can easily
understand the dependencies and subtasks. Graphs Are Good!

## TODO

- [ ] Build Asana API to pull projects, tasks, subtasks, and dependencies
- [ ] Create a D3 environment which can just have all the tasks on screen
- [ ] Add links between tasks and subtasks
- [ ] Display completed tasks differently
- [ ] Add links between tasks and dependencies
- [ ] Add a project selector to select the project to visualise
- [ ] Find a way to host this nicely and use oauth to access Asana data
